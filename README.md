Typed-PEG
============

![example workflow](https://github.com/lives-group/typed-peg/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Intro
------

Definition of a racket language for parsing expression grammars that generate a parse tree
and also provide a type directed semantics for pretty printing them. 
The library also uses a type inference algorithm which determines if the PEG is complete,
i.e. terminates its execution on all inputs.

Requirements
---------------

In order to type check, the tool need a working installation of 
[Z3 SMT Solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). The project is known to work with 
Z3 version 4.8.14.

Languages
-----------

Following the racket approach to build small languages, we have build some auxiliar languages 
to ease the task of use/debug the tool.

* `#lang typed-peg`: default language, provides a parse and pretty printing function for the
specified PEG, after infering types for the input PEG.
* `#lang typed-peg/untyped`: disable the type-inference engine. Use at your own risk!
* `#lang typed-peg/debug/tokenize-only`: outputs the result of the lexical analyser.
* `#lang typed-peg/debug/parse-only`: outputs the result of the parser.
* `#lang typed-peg/debug/constraints-only`: outputs the constraints generated by the algorithm.
* `#lang typed-peg/debug/z3-script-only`: outputs the z3 script that encode the constraints.
* `#lang typed-peg/debug/infer-only`: outputs the infered types for each grammar non-terminal.
